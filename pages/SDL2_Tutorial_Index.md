Welcome!
-
The goal of the following tutorials is to provide you with an introduction to SDL2 in C++. It's assumed
throught the series that you have some familiarity with C++ and are comfortable with functions, classes
and memory management. If you find yourself having trouble understanding the code in the tutorials
feel free to comment on the lesson and/or grab a good C++ book from this excellent list on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list).

The full source and assets for the tutorials can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Twinklebear/TwinklebearDev-Lessons). It may be helpful to check against this code to find errors, but it's important to not copy
directly as it will take away from the learning experience. If you ever have questions about the meaning
or functionality of SDL features head over to the [SDL documentation wiki](http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.fcg/FrontPage) and/or comment on the lesson page. You can also get help with SDL in the [SDL Forums](http://forums.libsdl.org/) or in the IRC at #SDL on freenode.
